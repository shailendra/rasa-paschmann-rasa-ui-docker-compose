please refer above URL for Installation of RASA, Python and other dependency

# Setup Using Docker-Compose
[https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/user-guide/running-rasa-with-docker/](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/user-guide/running-rasa-with-docker/) \
Install Docker and keep directory structure as below for docker compose.

```language
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ html
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rasa-ui
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ server
‚îÇ         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data
‚îÇ               ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îÇ               ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ  models
‚îÇ                      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml
```

now run below command to up docker containers

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

then connect to rasa container using below command 

```bash
docker exec -it  <rasa container id> bash
```

If you are upping docker container first time then there will not any file in **‚Äò/app/‚Äô** folder for training data, to create training data files you have to initialise new project, if already initialised then only training data file will create in **‚Äò/app/‚Äô** folder

```bash
rasa init --no-prompt
```

:warning: **Note - above command will overwrite all training data file with existing files if there any**

below files will create in **/app/** folder and will Training an initial model

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            __init__.py
        </td>
        <td>
            an empty file that helps python find your actions
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            actions.py
        </td>
        <td>
            code for your custom actions
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>config.yml ‚Äò*‚Äô
        </td>
        <td>configuration of your NLU and Core models
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>credentials.yml
        </td>
        <td>details for connecting to other services
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>data/nlu.md ‚Äò*‚Äô
        </td>
        <td>your NLU training data
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>data/stories.md ‚Äò*‚Äô
        </td>
        <td>your stories
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>domain.yml ‚Äò*‚Äô
        </td>
        <td>your assistant‚Äôs domain
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>endpoints.yml
        </td>
        <td>details for connecting to channels like fb messenger
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>models/&lt;timestamp&gt;.tar.gz
        </td>
        <td>your initial model
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br>
To set newly trained model, you need to down docker-compose using below command

```bash
docker-compose down
```


<br>

# Rasa Webchat
Use [Rasa webchat](https://github.com/botfront/rasa-webchat) widget to connect with a chatbot üí¨ platform. \
Create index.html in **/html/** folder and paste below code on body tag.

```html
<div id="webchat"/>
<script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/mrbot-cdn/webchat-latest.js"></script>
// Or you can replace latest with a specific version
<script>
  WebChat.default.init({
    selector: "#webchat",
    initPayload: "/get_started",
    customData: {"language": "en"},
    socketUrl: "http://localhost:5500",
    socketPath: "/socket.io/",
    title: "Title",
    subtitle: "Subtitle",
  })
</script>
```

To set backend connection between Rasa Webchat and Rasa server, below code in **/app/credentials.yml** file.

```yml
socketio:
  user_message_evt: user_uttered
  bot_message_evt: bot_uttered
  session_persistence: true
```

Now again up docker-compose using below command

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Now you can test your newly created chatbot on [http://localhost:8100/](http://localhost:8100/) url
<br><br><br>

# Train NLU model using RASA server

You can train your NLU model by editing training data file from **/app/ folder** 
<br><br>
After updates in  stories and NLU data, connect to rasa server and run command to train model.

```bash
docker exec -it  <rasa container id> bash
rasa train
```

This command will the trained model and save trained model into the **/app/models/** directory.
<br><br>
Whenever you train a model, you have to down the docker containers and again have to up the docker containers using the below command to make active newly trained model in production.

```bash
docker-compose down
```

then

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

<br><br>

# Train NLU model using [Rasa UI](https://github.com/paschmann/rasa-ui) server

You can train NLU model using Rasa UI web application. for more detail about Rasa UI check below link \

  utter_goodbye:
  - text: "Bye"
```

<br><br><br>

### Write Stories using intents and responses
Here, you will teach your chatbot how to respond to your messages. Core models learn from real conversational data in the form of training ‚Äústories‚Äù. A story is a real conversation between a user and chatbot. Lines with intents and entities reflect the user‚Äôs input and action names show what the chatbot should do in response.

Below is an example of a simple conversation. The user says hello, and the chatbot says "Hey! How are you?". This is how it looks as a story:

**story1**
```language
## happy path
* greet
  - utter_greet
* mood_great
  - utter_happy
```

Below are steps to add story in RASA UI
![select story tab](raw/select-story-tab.png)
1. Select the Story tab from the left side.
2. Select "rasa" bot from dropdown.

<br>

![click on plus button to add story](raw/create-story-plus.png)
Click on plus (+) button to add story

<br>

![expand story arrow](raw/story-click-plus-button.png)
Click on the arrow button to write the story.

<br>

![write story and save](raw/story-write-save.png)
1. Type "greet" in search box
2. from the dropdown click on "greet" intent. When you click on it, the "greet" intent will add in the story.
3. Then click on "utter_greet" action from the dropdown. 

Using the above steps add "mood_great" intent and "utter_happy" action. Now the story will look like below.
```language
## happy path
* greet
  - utter_greet
* mood_great
  - utter_happy
```
4. This is one story. Click on the save button to save this story.

Now add below stories using above steps
```language
## sad path 1
* greet
  - utter_greet
* mood_unhappy
  - utter_cheer_up
  - utter_did_that_help
* affirm
  - utter_happy

## sad path 2
* greet
  - utter_greet
* mood_unhappy
  - utter_cheer_up
  - utter_did_that_help
* deny
  - utter_goodbye

## say goodbye
* goodbye
  - utter_goodbye
```

<br><br><br>

### Train a Model
After any update in NLU or Core data, or update the domain or configuration, we need to train a model. Below are steps to Train a Model.

![Train a Model](raw/training-select-model-tab.png)
1. Select the "Training" tab from the left side.
2. Select "rasa" bot from dropdown.
3. add a comment. I have added "first training of model".
