**Installation of RASA** \
[https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/user-guide/installation/](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/user-guide/installation/)  
please refer above URL for Installation of RASA, Python and other dependency

# Setup Using Docker-Compose
[https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/user-guide/running-rasa-with-docker/](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/user-guide/running-rasa-with-docker/) \
Install Docker and keep directory structure as below for docker compose.

```language
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ html
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rasa-ui
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ server
‚îÇ         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data
‚îÇ               ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îÇ               ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ  models
‚îÇ                      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml
```

now run below command to up docker containers

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

then connect to rasa container using below command 

```bash
docker exec -it  <rasa container id> bash
```

If you are upping docker container first time then there will not any file in **‚Äò/app/‚Äô** folder for training data, to create training data files you have to initialise new project, if already initialised then only training data file will create in **‚Äò/app/‚Äô** folder

```bash
rasa init --no-prompt
```

:warning: **Note - above command will overwrite all training data file with existing files if there any**

below files will crate in **/app/** folder and will Training an initial model

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            __init__.py
        </td>
        <td>
            an empty file that helps python find your actions
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            actions.py
        </td>
        <td>
            code for your custom actions
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>config.yml ‚Äò*‚Äô
        </td>
        <td>configuration of your NLU and Core models
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>credentials.yml
        </td>
        <td>details for connecting to other services
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>data/nlu.md ‚Äò*‚Äô
        </td>
        <td>your NLU training data
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>data/stories.md ‚Äò*‚Äô
        </td>
        <td>your stories
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>domain.yml ‚Äò*‚Äô
        </td>
        <td>your assistant‚Äôs domain
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>endpoints.yml
        </td>
        <td>details for connecting to channels like fb messenger
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>models/&lt;timestamp&gt;.tar.gz
        </td>
        <td>your initial model
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br>
To set newly trained model, you need to down docker-compose using below command

```bash
docker-compose down
```


<br>

## Rasa Webchat
Use [Rasa webchat](https://github.com/botfront/rasa-webchat) widget to connect with a chatbot üí¨ platform. \
Create index.html in **/html/** folder and paste below code on body tag.

```html
<div id="webchat"/>
<script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/mrbot-cdn/webchat-latest.js"></script>
// Or you can replace latest with a specific version
<script>
  WebChat.default.init({
    selector: "#webchat",
    initPayload: "/get_started",
    customData: {"language": "en"},
    socketUrl: "http://localhost:5500",
    socketPath: "/socket.io/",
    title: "Title",
    subtitle: "Subtitle",
  })
</script>
```

To set backend connection between Rasa Webchat and Rasa server, below code in **/app/credentials.yml** file.

```yml
socketio:
  user_message_evt: user_uttered
  bot_message_evt: bot_uttered
  session_persistence: true
```

Now again up docker-compose using below command

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Now you can test your new created chatbot on [http://localhost:8100/](http://localhost:8100/) url
<br><br><br>

## Train NLU model using RASA server

You can train your NLU model by editing training data file from **/app/ folder** 
<br><br>
After updates in  stories and NLU data, connect to rasa server and run command to train model.

```bash
docker exec -it  <rasa container id> bash
rasa train
```

This command will the trained model and save trained model into the **/app/models/** directory.
<br><br>
Whenever you trained model, you have to down the docker containers and again have to up the docker containers using the below command to make active newly trained model in production.

```bash
docker-compose down
```

then

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

<br><br>

## Train NLU model using [Rasa UI](https://github.com/paschmann/rasa-ui) server

You can train NLU model using Rasa UI web application. for more detail about Rasa UI check below link \
[https://github.com/paschmann/rasa-ui](https://github.com/paschmann/rasa-ui)

You can connect Rasa UI web application on [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001) \
As per Rasa UI username is "admin" and password is "admin". but you can change this by editing environment variable from docker-compose.yml file. 
Now as per docker-compose.yml file login details are below \
**username - admin** \
**password - 321**

Use the below command to connect Rasa UI container

```language
docker exec -it <rasa_ui container id> sh
```

Below are steps to train NLU Model.

### Create a New Bot and Intents  
Connect Rasa UI web application on [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001).
![example1](raw/dashboard.jpg)
Select tab "Bots" from left side panel,

<br><br><br>

![example1](raw/create-bot.jpg)
Click on right top (+) button to add a new bot.

<br><br><br>


![example1](raw/bot-setting.png)
Give name for bot \
In **"Config"** field add pipeline and policies. keep below code in config

```yml
# Configuration for Rasa NLU.
# https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/nlu/components/
language: "en"

pipeline: "pretrained_embeddings_spacy"

# Configuration for Rasa Core.
# https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/policies/
policies:
  - name: KerasPolicy
    epochs: 100
    max_history: 1
  - name: FallbackPolicy
    fallback_action_name: 'action_default_fallback'
  - name: MemoizationPolicy
    max_history: 1
  - name: FormPolicy
  - name: MappingPolicy
```
For more information about Pipeline and Policies check below links \
[https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/nlu/choosing-a-pipeline/](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/nlu/choosing-a-pipeline/) \
[https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/policies/](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/policies/)

In **"Server Output Folder"** filed add path **/app/models/**.

<br><br><br>

 ![Select Bot](raw/select-bot.jpg)
 Now select newly created Bot

<br><br><br>

![Create New Intent](raw/create-new-intent.jpg)
Create Intents

<br><br><br>

![Save Intent](raw/save-intent.png)
Give name for Intent. I have given "greet". Then Save it.

<br><br><br>

![Selet Intent to Edit](raw/intent-to-edit.jpg)
Now Select newly created Intent "greet".

<br><br><br>

![Save edited Intent](raw/save-edited-intent.jpg)
Enter an expression and press enter. I have entered below expression for **"greet"** intent.
- hey
- hello
- hi
- good morning
- good evening
- hey there

Using below data ceate more Intent following above step. 

*intent -* **goodbye**
- bye
- goodbye

<br><br><br>

### Create responses/replies using Actions for intents/user inputs
![Selet response tab](raw/response-tab-select.png)
`1.` to create response for intent click on  **"Response"** from left side
<br>
2. Select **"rasa"** bot

<br><br><br>

### Write Your Stories using intents and responses
Here, you will teach your assistant how to respond to your messages. Core models learn from real conversational data in the form of training ‚Äústories‚Äù. A story is a real conversation between a user and an assistant. Lines with intents and entities reflect the user‚Äôs input and action names show what the assistant should do in response.

Below is an example of a simple conversation. The user says hello, and the assistant says hello back. This is how it looks as a story:

**story1**
```language
## happy path
* greet
  - utter_greet
* mood_great
  - utter_happy
```

Below are steps to add story in RASA UI
![select story tab](raw/select-story-tab.png)
`1. `Select Story tab from left side.
<br>
`2. `Select "rasa" bot.

<br>

![click on plus button to add story](raw/create-story-plus.png)
Click on plus (+) button to add story

<br>

![expand story arrow](raw/story-click-plus-button.png)
Click on arrow button to write story.

<br>

![write story and save](raw/story-write-save.png)
1. This is an example of a simple conversation. The user says hello for this write intent greet as "* greet", and the assistant says hello back for this write utter as "   - utter_greet". also write for mood_happy. story will look link below.
```language
## happy path
* greet
  - utter_greet
* mood_great
